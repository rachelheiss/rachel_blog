My name is **Rachel Heiss**, and I'm a home schooled sophomore in high school. I'm currently in [Kaneâ€™s Free High School Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info), which is why I'm making this practice website. I have five younger siblings and live near Atlanta, Georgia. I enjoy reading, writing, baking, Marvel movies, and listening to musicals, podcasts, and Taylor Swift. \n\n## Contact Me\n* **Email:** rachelheiss@gmail.com\n* **GitHub:** [rachelheiss](https://github.com/rachelheiss)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
