## About Me
I'm going to just use something I wrote in a tutorial a few days ago as my introduction for now. Hello! My name is **Rachel Heiss**, and I'm a home schooled sophomore in high school. I'm currently in [Kaneâ€™s Free High School Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info), which is why I'm making this practice website. I have five younger siblings and live near Atlanta, Georgia. I enjoy reading, writing, baking, Marvel movies, and listening to musicals, podcasts, and Taylor Swift.
