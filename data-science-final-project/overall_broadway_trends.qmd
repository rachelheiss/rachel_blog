These graphs show Broadway's yearly average ticket prices and theatre capacity filled.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
obt_graph_1 <- read_rds("plot_average_ticket_price.rds")
obt_graph_1 
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
obt_graph_2 <- read_rds("plot_pct_cap.rds") 
obt_graph_2 
```

As you can see, both ticket prices and the percent of seats filled have been going up, but people aren't filling up theatres because it costs more to attend showsâ€” Broadway's just gotten more popular over the years and prices have gotten higher because demand is high and people are willing to pay.
